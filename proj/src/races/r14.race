And even though the moment passed me by, I still can't turn away. 'Cause all the dreams you never thought you'd lose got tossed along the way. And letters that you never meant to send got lost or thrown away. And now we're grown up orphans that never knew their names. We don't belong to no one; that's a shame. If you could hide inside me, maybe for a while, and I won't tell no one your name.
